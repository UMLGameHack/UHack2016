## First Game Project at a Hackathon


A guitar Hero / RPG game element. Players can choose to either play the regular keyboard or play the guitar to boost and help their teammates to defeat the boss!  
The project was going well, but then an error occurred in Unity that prevented us from using the Guitar as the main controller.

Progress based on day:

1. the game was in the progress of being made along with how the guitar works 
2. The game was completed but seemed “boring”, and the guitar idea did not work, a new plan and game was assigned
3. Finish our awesome team game and demo it to people.
